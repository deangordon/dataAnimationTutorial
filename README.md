# Data Animation Tutorial
Thanks for your interest in data animations. I'm no expert in this area, but I've put together these short tutorials to show you how far you can get with just a little bit of knowledge. 
## What's in these tutorials?
These tutorials contain 3 data animations. In some ways they are not that good and demonstrate the fact that data animations are not always a good way to communicate information. However, they show you some of the options available for animations and include reading in files and other basic parts of R that you'll need.

These animation use gganimate which in turn uses ggplot, a popular R package for graphs. The actual animations part is quite straight-forward and more time is spent working with ggplot. This is not an introduction to ggplot: you should be able to follow along even if you have not used ggplot before, but you could really benefit from finding out more about how to use ggplot. The first (free) chapter of [this Datacamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1) would be a useful introduction.
## What do I need to follow them?
R, R Studio and a few packages. More specifically, you'll need R version 3.1 or greater (tested on 3.4.3, documentation indicates should work on 3.1). The packages you'll need are *gapminder, gifski, png, tidyverse* and *RColorBrewer*. ggplot, which gganimate depends on, will need to be version 3.0 or greater, so if you have an older version you might need to update that.

Instructions on how to install packages are included in the lab01 document.
